st - simple terminal
--------------------
st is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less.

Customizations
--------------

- Changed colours to be gruvbox like
- Changed the font
- Installed the vimbrowse patch
- Installed the spoiler patch
- Installed the newterm patch (I also fixed a compilation warning about the
  result of chrdir not being used)
- Installed copyurl patch
- Installed openclipboard patch (And fixed compile warning)
- Installed bold is not bright patch


BRANCHES
--------

- master branch is what I use
- upstream-master is a branch I use to track the suckless repository so that I
  can easily merge updates into my build
- All remaining branches are branches for specific patches, branched from
  upstream master, so that I can merge them back in to master


Requirements
------------
In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running st
----------
If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile
the st terminfo entry with the following command:

    tic -sx st.info

See the man page for additional details.
